      <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
      <p id="preamble">
        The YACU, or the Young Americans Coalition for Unity, is a student-run organization 
        and club dedicated to the pursuit of political participation and bipartisanship among the youth.
      </p>
      <p id="locality">
        Our local Scarsdale branch of the YACU hosts weekly debates and discussions on current events, political issues, 
        and problems surrounding our community as well as other events in an effort to 
        involve the youth of Scarsdale in political change. 
      </p>

    <content id="about_us">
      <h1>WHAT DO WE DO?</h1>
      <p id="identity">
        The YACU Scarsdale Chapter engages in regular political debate and discussion aimed at current events and political issues. 
        We attempt to keep our members informed and active with political events in the world, and encourage them to formulate and communicate their opinions on these political events. 
        We also host volunteering work and other extracurricular activities to engage our members in the community and amongst themselves; 
        we hope that by doing so we can forge strong bonds within our club and connect with and help our community.
